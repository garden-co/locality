## 📊 Data Model

The application uses a rich data model defined in `jazz-schema.ts`:

- **Organization**: Top-level entity that contains teams and members
- **Team**: Group within an organization that owns issues
- **Issue**: Task or project item with status, priority, and assignee
- **Comment**: Discussion attached to issues
- **Label**: Categorization for issues with color coding
- **Attachment**: Files attached to issues or comments
- **UserProfile**: User information with online presence

The schema leverages Jazz's collaborative data types (CoMap, CoList, CoFeed) to enable real-time collaboration and updates.

## 🧩 UI Components

The UI is built with a combination of:

- **Radix UI primitives**: Accessible, unstyled components
- **shadcn/ui**: Styled components built on Radix
- **Custom components**: Domain-specific components for issues, teams, etc.

The design follows modern UI patterns with a clean, minimal aesthetic similar to Linear.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pnpm install
   ```
3. Run the development server:
   ```
   pnpm dev
   ```
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## 💻 Development Practices

- **TypeScript**: Strict typing for all components and functions
- **Component Architecture**: Small, reusable components
- **Server/Client Separation**: Clear boundaries between server and client code
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach
- **Accessibility**: Built on accessible primitives from Radix UI
